the project starts as a direct extract of the powercli info from the security guide with the following goals in mind:

1. primarily focus on creating an audit script with legible and useful output
2. create a hardening process where certain items can be enabled/disable as seen fit
3. ultimately pass a CIS Audit for VMware 6.5 should one be created
